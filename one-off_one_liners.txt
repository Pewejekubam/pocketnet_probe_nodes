Hello everybody! I haven't written to you for a long time. I want to tell you a little about the storage of Wallet.dat. It can be stored as a file, or it can be on a piece of paper - if you write down the main secret! For those who keep private keys from their wallet, this method will not help you recover the entire amount of coins if they were transferred from this address, since the money is returned to another one!!! 
For the normal storage of the main secret of the wallet and its subsequent recovery, you need to write the Dumpwallet command in the console (file name), you will have a text document with all the keys - the same easy node file gives. Open this document and look for the HDSEED line - to the left of this inscription will be the key - the main secret of the wallet! We save it.
To restore - create a new empty wallet, enter sethdseed (key) in the console, and then do a RescanBlockchain / this way we will completely restore our wallet!

You can also add ( disconnect last 2103000), this command will roll back the blockchain itself to the desired block!
